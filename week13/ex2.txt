The simpliest approach to deal with deadlocks is to ignore them. But it will not decrease user experience only if deadlocks occur rarely, and also data losses are little.

In case if there is information about resources used, and when their usages can lead to deadlock, we can rely on recovery strategy once the deadlock has happened.

When a machine can definitely predict process' usage of resources, we can get rid of deadlocks by avoiding actions that will lead to it. 
In real world, it is almost impossible to completely get rid of deadlocks. It requires information about future resources, that isn't available for real systems

If any of 4 Coffman conditions can be eliminated, it is better to use prevention strategy.
